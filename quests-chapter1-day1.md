1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

A blockchain is similar to a distributed database, with some key differences. In particular, most are considered decentralized (as in no single entity should control them), open and public (anyone should be able to publish into and read data from it, think opposite closed app gardens like Apple Store and Google Play). In a sense, all the nodes that host the blockchain and make it work, also validate the content and make sure a modification is legitiamete before allowing it, that's why we usually read that blockchains are immutable and unhackable. Althought that's only partially correct.

2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts

A Smart Contract is a way to use the blockchain, basically a series of functions (rules) and parameters (provided data) that allows you to store and use that information in the blockchain. This contract of "rules" is stored in the blockchain itself to allow it to work. Another way to look at Smart Contracts would be to think in cooking recipes, where you have a series of steps and data. Think "if we use this (flour, milk, eggs) then we get that (pancakes!)".

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

A transaction is a glorified, paid function call ;) that allows you to change data on the blockchain while a script is used to view it, and doesn't cost anything. When you "submit" something to the blockchain, you are doing a transaction, when you read from it you are using a script.
