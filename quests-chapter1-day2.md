1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

  1. Safety and security
  2. Clarity
  3. Approachability
  4. Developer experience
  5. Intuiting ownership with resources (or Resource oriented programming)

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

The 5 pillars are supposed to make Flow blockchain accesible both for developers and users. By having a secure framework we avoid issues that could compromise DApps and be a bad experience for users. Having clear and readble code helps accomplish not only a better, secure system, allowing us to find mistakes more easily, but also helps to onboard new people into the ecosystem. This clarity is not alone when trying to onboard new developers, approachability is increased in Cadence (the Flow Blockchain language for Smart Contracts) by using features from known languages like Swift and Rust. Finally, putting all this together we can see that the focus on improving the developer experience is a core value of Flow because we need developers for it to succeeed[1]. Last but not least, resource oriented programming is a differentiator in Cadence that's not present in other blockchains, this is particularly useful for NFT where the account owning the assets is free to transfer them without the need for a central smart contract (and the transaction costs involved).
